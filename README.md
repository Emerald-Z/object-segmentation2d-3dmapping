# Object Segmentation and 2D to 3D point projection

This is a library built on top of Azure Kinect's SDK from Microsoft. Here we aim to take objects segmented from 2D rgb images and project them into a 3D space. Reference code can be found on the Azure Kinect website or from the UTexas Kinect-wrapper repository.
